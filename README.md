This was a project that I worked on for my Computer Science 124 class at the University of Illinois. A lot of the structure of this project was pre-made for me by the staff, but almost all of it I needed to fix or implement myself using some instruction from the course staff. This project used a spread sheet from a server of people’s favorite places and then plotted it on a map. We got to also implement a feature of our own design independently as part of the project. I chose to implement a google like search bar where you could filter out results by putting a word after a ‘-‘ instead of just searching for a word.

What Concepts/Tools Were Utilized - 

Java programming
Reading/Writing from servers
Working with JSON files(reading and writing)
Android development with Android Studio
Graphical User Interface development
Searching algorithms
Collaborative programming – working with interfaces that were premade and sticking to 1 type of style so that code is interoperable.
